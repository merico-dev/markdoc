# Test coverage

Test coverage is proportion of functions covered by test cases to total functions.

## Introduction

In computer science, test coverage is a percentage measure of the degree to which the source code of a program is executed when a particular test suite is run. A program with high test coverage has more of its source code executed during testing, which suggests it has a lower chance of containing undetected software bugs compared to a program with low test coverage.

## Formula

Test coverage = Number of functions covered by test cases / Number of total functions
